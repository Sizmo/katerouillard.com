        <h2 class="work-title">How I Work</h2>
        <h3 class="">Translation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I <span class="">translate</span> the document as close to word-for-word as possible ensuring the
                essence of the original text is captured perfectly.</li>
            <li>I <span class="">review</span> the English translation and fix anything that doesn't sound right and any
                clunky or unclear sentences. I refer to the original text for clarification.</li>
            <li>I <span class="">compare</span> the two texts and double-check that everything has been properly carried
                over to the translation.</li>
            <li>I <span class="">proofread</span> the English translation to make sure it's a natural, easy and clear
                read.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="">Content and Copywriting</h3>
        <p>For both content and copywriting, a detailed brief from the client goes a long way to save time on both
            sides. The more detail I have about the type of content or copy you need, the faster I can fulfil your
            requirements.</p>
        <h3>Consider the following:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="">Tone</span>: would you like the text to sound friendly, formal, informal,
                serious
                or lighthearted?</li>
            <li><span class="">Audience</span>: is the audience an expert in the field or completely new to
                the
                topic?</li>
            <li><span class="">Intent</span>: is the piece informing, describing or telling a story?</li>
            <li><span class="">Focus</span>: is there a specific aspect of the topic you would like me to
                focus
                on or is it a more general discussion of the topic?</li>
            <li>Do you have any <span class="">style</span> requirements?</li>
            <li>What is your desired <span class="">word count</span>?</li>
            <li>Are there specific <span class="">keywords</span> I should include?</li>
            <li>What is the <span class="">turnaround</span> time?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="">Content writing</span> usually starts with a deep dive into the topic. I learn as much
            as
            I can on the topic to write <span class="">comprehensive, unique content</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="">Copywriting</span> requires intimate knowledge of the product.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How does it meet your customers' <span class="">needs</span>?</li>
            <li>What are its <span class="">benefits</span> and <span class="">features</span>?
            </li>
            <li>What <span class="">challenges</span> do your customers face?</li>
            <li>What are your <span class="">competitors</span> doing? Where are they falling short?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With this information, I create <span class="">captivating copy that converts</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="">Editing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I run a simple <span class="">grammar</span> and <span class="">spelling</span>
                check
                to catch any errors.</li>
            <li>I read the text several times and fix any <span class="">style</span> and <span class="">syntax</span>
                errors. <span class="">Consistency</span> is key so I
                conform spelling and measuring unit choices, etc.</li>
            <li>I amend the <span class="">format</span> if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="">Content could be the difference between your business succeeding or failing.</p>
        <p class="">I create <span class="">high quality content that helps your business succeed</span>.</p>
