		<h1>Background</h1>

		<p>Growing up on the east coast of South Africa, I enjoyed the warm winters and suffered
			through the hot, humid summers. After spending a few years on the other side of the country (where delicious wine is made!), my husband convinced me to leave the vineyards and relocate to a tiny island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius. Here, we have created a beautiful home with our baby girl and fox terrier, Odie.</p>

				<p class="photo-caption">Who's walking who?</p>
		</div>

		<p>When I'm not looking for seductive words or creating juicy content, I enjoy going on walks with Odie and teaching my tiny human some yoga.</p>
		<p>I was never any good at the fact-based subjects so I was relieved to find I had a knack for languages. At school, I studied English, French and Zulu.</p>
		<p>Arriving at the University of Cape Town, I was unsure of what subjects to study. I was
			nervous that focusing my studies on languages wouldn't lead to a prosperous future. However, during orientation, I found the bravery I lacked when a dashing English lecturer encouraged the first-year students to follow their hearts (be damned what anyone else thought!). Heeding this advice, I signed up for English, French and German majors (with a course of Psychology just in case).</p>
		<p>Studying languages at UCT was a dream come true. Examining the greats of English
			literature in the bustling library and exploring language on a daily basis - what more could a young
			linguaphile want?</p>
		<p>But the learning didn't stop with graduation. Language is dynamic - and keeping up with it is half the fun! I love to read and keep up with the newest developments. I enjoy uncovering new skills too. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of copywriting and SEO.</p>
