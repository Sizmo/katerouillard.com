		<p>Growing up on the east coast of <span class="mark">South Africa</span>, Kate enjoyed the warm winters and suffered through the hot, humid summers. After spending a few years on the other side of the country (where delicious wine is made!), Kate's husband convinced her to leave the vineyards and relocate to a <span class="highlighted">tiny island in the Indian Ocean</span>, Mauritius. Here, they have created a beautiful home with their <span class="highlighted">baby girl</span> and fox terrier, <span class="highlighted">Odie</span>.</p>

		</div>

		<p>
		 As much as Kate <span class="highlighted">enjoys her job</span>, sitting is supposed to be the new smoking so she tries to get up and about us much as possible. She enjoys taking Odie on <span class="highlighted">walks</span>, focusing her mind on <spam class="highlighted">yoga</spam> and getting her heart pumping with some <span class="highlighted">fast-paced exercise</span> routines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kate was never any good at the fact-based subjects so she was relieved to find she had a <span class="highlighted">knack for languages</span>. At school, she studied English, French and Zulu.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arriving at the <span class="highlighted">University of Cape Town</span>, she was unsure of what subjects to study. Kate was nervous that focusing her studies on languages wouldn't lead to a prosperous future. However, during orientation, she found the bravery she lacked when a dashing English lecturer encouraged the first-year students to <span class="highlighted">follow their hearts</span> (be damned what anyone else thought!). Heeding this advice, Kate signed up for <span class="highlighted">English, French and German majors</span> (with a course of Psychology just in case).
		</p>
		<p>
			Studying languages at UCT was a <span class="highlighted">dream come true</span>. Examining the greats of English literature in the bustling library and exploring language on a daily basis - what more could a young linguaphile want?
		</p>
		<p>
			But the learning didn't stop with graduation! Language is dynamic. Kate <span class="highlighted">loves to read</span> and keep up with the newest developments. She enjoys uncovering new skills too. Currently, she is expanding her <span class="highlighted">knowledge of copywriting and SEO</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kate's love of English makes her <span class="highlighted">the perfect person to assist you</span> with all your content needs.
