          Growing up on the east coast of South Africa, I enjoyed the warm
          winters and suffered through the hot, humid summers. After spending a
          few years on the other side of the country (where delicious wine is
          made!), my husband convinced me to leave the vineyards and relocate to
          a tiny island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius. Here, we have created a
          beautiful home with our baby girl and fox terrier, Odie.
        </p>

          src="images/amelia-odie.jpg"
          loading="lazy"
          alt="Amelia taking Odie for a walk, or Odie taking Amelia for a walk?"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="bg-text-p">
        <p>
          When I'm not looking for seductive words or creating juicy content, I
          enjoy going on walks with Odie and teaching my tiny human some yoga.

          I was never any good at the fact-based subjects so I was relieved to
          find I had a knack for languages. At school, I studied English, French
          and Zulu.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-text-p">

          Arriving at the University of Cape Town, I was unsure of what subjects
          to study. I was nervous that focusing my studies on languages wouldn't
          lead to a prosperous future. However, during orientation, I found the
          bravery I lacked when a dashing English lecturer encouraged the
          first-year students to follow their hearts (be damned what anyone else
          thought!). Heeding this advice, I signed up for English, French and
          German majors (with a course of Psychology just in case).

          Studying languages at UCT was a dream come true. Examining the greats
          of English literature in the bustling library and exploring language
          on a daily basis - what more could a young linguaphile want?

          But the learning didn't stop with graduation. Language is dynamic -
          and keeping up with it is half the fun! I love to read and keep up
          with the newest developments. I enjoy uncovering new skills too.
          Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of copywriting and SEO.
