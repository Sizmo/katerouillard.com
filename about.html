		<h1>Background</h1>

		<p>Growing up on the east coast of <span class="">South Africa</span>, I enjoyed the warm winters and suffered
			through the hot, humid summers. After spending a few years on the other side of the country (where delicious
			wine is made!), my husband convinced me to leave the vineyards and relocate to a <span class="">tiny island
				in the Indian Ocean</span>, Mauritius. Here, we have created a beautiful home with our <span
				class="">baby girl</span> and fox terrier, <span class="">Odie</span>.</p>

					alt="Amelia taking Odie for a walk, or Odie taking Amelia for a walk?">
			</div>
				<p class="photo-caption">Who's walking who?</p>
		</div>

		<p>When I'm not looking for seductive words or creating juicy content, I enjoy going on walks with Odie and teaching my tiny human some yoga.</p>
		<p>I was never any good at the fact-based subjects so I was relieved to find I had a <span class="">knack for
				languages</span>. At school, I studied English, French and Zulu.</p>
		<p>
			Arriving at the <span class="">University of Cape Town</span>, I was unsure of what subjects to study. I was
			nervous that focusing my studies on languages wouldn't lead to a prosperous future. However, during
			orientation, I found the bravery I lacked when a dashing English lecturer encouraged the first-year students
			to <span class="">follow their hearts</span> (be damned what anyone else thought!). Heeding this advice, I
			signed up for <span class="">English, French and German majors</span> (with a course of Psychology just in
			case).
		</p>
		<p>
			Studying languages at UCT was a <span class="">dream come true</span>. Examining the greats of English
			literature in the bustling library and exploring language on a daily basis - what more could a young
			linguaphile want?
		</p>
		<p>
			But the learning didn't stop with graduation! Language is dynamic - and keeping up with it is half the fun! I <span class="">love to read</span> and
			keep up with the newest developments. I enjoy uncovering new skills too. Currently, I am expanding my <span
				class="">knowledge of copywriting and SEO</span>.
