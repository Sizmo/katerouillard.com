            <h3 class="">Translation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I <span class="">translate</span> the document as close to word-for-word as possible ensuring the
                    essence of the original text is captured perfectly.</li>
                <li>I <span class="">review</span> the English translation and fix anything that doesn't sound right and
                    any
                    clunky or unclear sentences. I refer to the original text for clarification.</li>
                <li>I <span class="">compare</span> the two texts and double-check that everything has been properly
                    carried
                    over to the translation.</li>
                <li>I <span class="">proofread</span> the English translation to make sure it's a natural, easy and
                    clear
                    read.</li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h3 class="">Content and Copywriting</h3>
            <p>For both copy and content writing, a detailed brief from the client goes a long way to save time on both
                sides. The more detail I have about the type of content or copy you need, the faster I can fulfil your
                requirements.</p>
        </section>

        <h4>Consider the following:</h4>
        <section  class="align-left">
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="">Tone</span>: would you like the text to sound friendly, formal, informal,
                        serious
                        or lighthearted?</li>
                    <li><span class="">Audience</span>: is the audience an expert in the field or completely new to
                        the
                        topic?</li>
                    <li><span class="">Intent</span>: is the piece informing, describing or telling a story?</li>
                    <li><span class="">Focus</span>: is there a specific aspect of the topic you would like me to
                        focus
                        on or is it a more general discussion of the topic?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any <span class="">style</span> requirements?</li>
                    <li>What is your desired <span class="">word count</span>?</li>
                    <li>Are there specific <span class="">keywords</span> I should include?</li>
                    <li>What is the <span class="">turnaround</span> time?</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <p class="longer">Content writing starts with a deep dive into the topic. I learn as much as I can about the subject so I can write a comprehensive and unique piece. I can come up with my own take or you can point me in the direction you want me to go.</p>
        
            <section>
                <p>Copywriting requires intimate knowledge of the product.</p>
            <ol class="align-left">
                <li>How does it meet your customers' needs?</li>
                <li>What are its benefits and features?</li>
                <li>What challenges do your customers face?</li>
                <li>What are your competitors doing? Where are they falling short?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="align-left">With this information, I create captivating copy that converts.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Editing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I run a simple grammar and spelling check to catch any glaring errors.</li>
            <li>I read the text several times and fix any style and syntax errors.</li>
            <li>Consistency is key so I conform spelling and measuring unit choices, etc.</li>
            <li>I amend the format if desired.</li>
        </ol>
